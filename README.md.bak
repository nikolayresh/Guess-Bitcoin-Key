# Guess Bitcoin Key
A small application that gives you a tiny chance to guess the private keys of specified Bitcoin wallets.

All you have to do is to add Bitcoin wallet addresses to the file **Wallets.txt** and start this app as a simple Windows service, leaving it to work in background for a couple of weeks.
You can specify a wallet in any form of Bitcoin addresses: **Legacy**, **Native SegWit** or **SegWit**.
Probability to hit the correct private key of at least a single Bitcoin wallet is low, but your chances will increase dramatically if you specify millions of wallets in your file. 
**Don't forget to include only the wallets with balance!**

If you get lucky to crack a wallet or just want to support this app, then don't hesitate to donate to this Bitcoin address:

I would be very grateful for your donations!  
Good luck!
